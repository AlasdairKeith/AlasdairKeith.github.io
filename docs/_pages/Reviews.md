I enjoy reading both scientific and non-scientific works. Below, in no particular order, are three lists, two of which contain contain (very!) short reviews, one of interesting scientific books I've read, and the other for non-scientific works I am passionate about or have had a profound impact on my life. I also include a complete list of the scientific papers I have read since joining Emory, mainly for my own benefit, so that I don't forget what I have and have not read!

<font size="6">Scientific Books</font>

[Atom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3961946-atom) by Piers Bizony.<br>
I read this book as a young teenager and it, more than any other, encouraged me to pursue a career in science. Accompanying the BBC series of the same name (presented by Jim al-Khalili), this book explored the origins of atomic theory through to the modern day in a very accessible way.

[Linux in Easy Steps](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/919171.Linux_in_Easy_Steps?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_19) by Mike McGrath.<br>
[Coding for Beginners in Easy Steps](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24612373-coding-for-beginners-in-easy-steps?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_34) by Mike McGrath.<br>
[Python in Easy Steps](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17347349-python-in-easy-steps?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_20) by Mike McGrath.<br>
[C++ Programming in Easy Steps](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1469589.C_Programming_In_Easy_Steps?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_29) by Mike McGrath.<br>
These books are excellent for a beginner to coding. I used them to teach myself the basics. They are beautifully laid out, making the worked examples very easy to follow.

[Homo Deus – A Brief History of Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_9) by Yuval Noah Harari.<br>
This book contains some very thought-provoking hypotheses regarding possible human 'progress', particularly with regards to transhumanism.

[What is Life?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162780.What_Is_Life_with_Mind_and_Matter_and_Autobiographical_Sketches?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_22) by Erwin Schrödinger.<br>
Erwin Schrödinger was one of the greatest physicists of the early 20th century. In this short book, he speculates on the effect advances in physics in his day may have on the future of biology. Many of his predictions have proved remarkably prescient.

[Life on the Edge - The Coming of Age of Quantum Biology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24040194-life-on-the-edge?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16) by Jim al-Khalili and Johnjoe McFadden.<br>
This popular science book combines two great passions of mine - quantum mechanics and molecular biology. It is very readable (I believe Jim al-Khalili to be the greatest science communicator alive today) and provides many intriguing ideas for applications of quantum theory to investigate some current mysteries of nature.

[Neural Networks for Chemists - An Introduction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15618281-neural-networks-for-chemists?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_24) by Jure Zupan and Johann Gasteiger.<br>
I read this because I was interested in applying machine learning principles to an aspect of my PhD research. This book was helpful in that regard but I would not recommend it to someone without a basic knowledge of the subject.

[What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662-what-if-serious-scientific-answers-to-absurd-hypothetical-questions?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_7) by Randall Munroe.<br>
[How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43852758-how-to?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16) by Randall Munroe.<br>
Randall Munroe is famous to geeks everywhere as the creator of online science comic, xkcd. In these two books, he takes absurd scientific questions from the public, and attempts to answer them in the most ridiculous (yet scientifically rigourous) ways possible. Very entertaining but also surprisingly thought-provoking. Would recommend for amateur science aficionados and career scientists alike.

[This is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35510008-this-is-going-to-hurt?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_21) by Adam Kay.<br>
Not strictly a science book, but a very good and entertaining insight into the disfunction of the NHS.

[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61539.The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions?ref=nav_sb_noss_l_9) by Thomas S. Kuhn.<br>
I believe every scientist should read this book. Widely recognised as the greatest book ever written about the philosophy of science, this work suggests that scientific progress is not actually linear, and instead is disrupted by periods of 'revolution' when old theories become too unwieldy to incorporate new data. Historical examples would include the astronomical findings which forced Copernicus to conclude that the solar system follows a heliocentric model rather than a geocentric one, or the quantum mechanical findings of the early 20th century which required Newtonian mechanics, under certain circumstances, to be abandoned. As part of this theory, the now-common phrase 'paradigm shift' was first introduced in this work. Upon reading this book, I wondered if scientific progress actually follows a Darwinian model, and became really excited to write a paper on this topic, only to find that Dr Kuhn had considered this himself later in his life!

[The Love Hypothesis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56732449-the-love-hypothesis?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11) by Ali Hazelwood.<br>
My girlfriend and I were nearly kicked out of a bookstore after picking this book up and laughing uproariously at its contents. I therefore bought it, and read it through. It's a very funny account of the trials and tribulations (many of which I identified with!) of a fictional PhD biology student, clearly written by somebody who knows what academia at that level is like. Would recommend to anybody who likes a good laugh.

[Physics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366330.Physics?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_12) by Aristotle.<br>
I'm convinced that Aristotle was the greatest mind of all time, and the first proper scientist. His _Physics_ is very dense, written as somewhat rough-and-ready lecture notes. Despite some of his conclusions having been debunked by modern studies, this work is still exceptionally insightful, especially with regards to issues of motion and time. His notion of the uncreated creator (first cause) is profound.

[The Epigenetics Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12414734-the-epigenetics-revolution?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_9) by Nessa Carey.<br>
This book served as an exceptionally good introduction to the increasingly important field of epigenetics (i.e. 'beyond genetics'). It shows that living organisms, including ourselves, are not just products of our genetic code, but how such code in interpreted. Indeed, within the book, Carey beautifully states that our genetic code is not a blueprint (as is often naively thought by the general public) but is instead a dramatic script, which can be interpreted in multiple different ways. This book, though billed as 'popular science', is probably too advanced for the general reader. I think it should be required reading though for all biochemists and molecular biologists.

[The Selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16) by Richard Dawkins.<br>
The Royal Society regards this book as one of the most important scientific works of all time, and I tend to agree. The main thrust of the book is that the main unit of life is not individual beings (with our bodies merely being vehicles) but instead is our genetic code. Whilst on the surface a very bleak view of life, Professor Dawkins takes great pains to show that beauty can still arise from this threory. A very thought-provoking book which I think should be read by scientists and non-scientists alike.

[Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58647975-viral?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_10) by Alina Chan and Matt Ridley.<br>
A very interesting book which investigates the theory that the COVID-19 virus arose from a lab-leak, rather than a zoonotic event. Whilst no firm conclusions can be drawn without the cooperation of the Chinese Government, this book raises some very important questions. Of particular interest is the furin cleavage site, and the codons used to generate it.

[Wilson and Walker's Principles and Techniques of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35021933-wilson-and-walker-s-principles-and-techniques-of-biochemistry-and-molecu?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=U2Awi8CXhX&rank=15) by Andreas Hofmann and Samuel Clokie.<br>
I thought I'd read this textbook to reacquaint myself with the theory and common lab-based practice of biochemistry and molecular biology techniques. It is an excellent intro to the subject for both beginners and experienced professionals alike.

[Energy Landscapes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6599665-energy-landscapes?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_17) by David J. Wales.<br>
This textbook was written by my PhD supervisor, so I'm obliged to like it! It provides an excellent, advanced analysis of energy landscape theory, which Professor Wales has done so much to develop. I found the chapters on applications to biomolecules particularly relevant to my PhD research, as I developed some of the methods to study protein-ligand interactions.

[Molecular Driving Forces: Statistical Thermodynamics in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Nanoscience](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/610203.Molecular_Driving_Forces?ref=nav_sb_ss_2_8) by Ken A. Dill and Sarina Bromberg.<br>
This is another excellent textbook describing thermodynamic and kinetic principles important to chemical and biological research. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I felt this textbook was written in a style rather unlike those typically found in this field. This proved to be a great advantage of the book, as it allowed me to consider these problems from a different (and I felt more intuitive) perspective.

<font size="6">Non-Scientific</font>

[East of Eden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_12) by John Steinbeck.<br>
[The Grapes of Wrath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_19) by John Steinbeck.<br>
I chose to study these two novels for my Advanced Higher English dissertation, and I'm so glad I did. _East of Eden_ is a celebration of the individual spirit, whilst _The Grapes of Wrath_ teaches the importance of a collective consciousness. These two novels, juxtaposed, gave me much to think about with regards to an individual's role within society.

[The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17166726-the-haunted-man-and-the-ghost-s-bargain?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_20) by Charles Dickens.<br>
When it comes to Charles Dickens' Christmas writings, most people think of _A Christmas Carol_. However, this later novella he wrote has inspired me deeply. It was the book which gave me hope in a world often filled with despair. The main character, Redlaw, is a chemist (see why it might appeal to me?) who questions why there is so much suffering in life. He is haunted by a ghost, who offers for such suffering to disappear. Upon this, what Redlaw finds is that, in the absence of suffering, all of his friends and acquaintances become very cold to one another. He realises that without suffering, there cannot be love, and so asks for the ghost to reverse his offer.

[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/921359.The_Ragged_Trousered_Philanthropists?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16) by Robert Tressell.<br>
The greatest, most authentic novel of English working class life. This book is an excellent socialist critique of the hypocrisies and inconsistencies of the class system and capitalism in Edwardian England.

[The Fall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11991.The_Fall?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_8) by Albert Camus.<br>
This short novella is an excellent contemplation of the alienation and self-destruction of a once-successful lawyer. Because of one (admittedly shameful) event in his life, he comes to despise himself. This novel therefore demonstrates how fickle life can be. Its second-person narrative is extraordinarily gripping. Expect to read this book in one sitting.

[Moby-Dick or, The Whale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_the_Whale?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_4) by Herman Melville.<br>
I think this is the greatest novel I've ever read. I perhaps identify with it because many of my ancestors were involved in whale-hunting. It's so much more than a story about hunting a white whale though. It's a contemplation on life, fate and obsession. The events towards the end of the book are almost suffocating. You finish the novel feeling you've been involved in the whale hunt (and so much more) yourself!

[The Analects](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27297.The_Analects?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_12) by Confucius.<br>
[Mencius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/614121.Mencius?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Nnd0SVxjEe&rank=1) by Mencius.<br>
I have a deep interest in Confucian philosophy. _The Analects_ is the foundational text for this school, outlining, in his own words, many of Confucius' teachings. I find his teachings eminently sensible, and focused on practical aspects of life, such as statecraft and familial relations. As such, it conflicts neither with science nor religion. We could all do with absorbing his philosophy. Menius is regarded as the 'second sage', after only Confucius himself. His work, _Mencius_, is extraordinarily profound, and encouraged me to reject the Western, Augustinian notion that human beings are corrupted by sin, and instead accept the (I think more hopeful!) conclusion that human beings are inherently good.

[The House at Pooh Corner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/776407.The_House_at_Pooh_Corner?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16) by A.A. Milne.<br>
This was my Granny's favourite book, and so therefore has great sentimental value for me. When she was ill, my brother and I would read stories from this to her (voices included!). It truly is a book for all ages.

[The Nicomachean Ethics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19068.The_Nicomachean_Ethics?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_13) by Aristotle.<br>
Like his _Physics_ (see above), I don't think Aristotle ever intended for this work to be published in written form. As such, it's structured as (sometimes elliptical) lecture notes rather than a complete book. Despite this, the work is extraordinarily profound. This work basically founded the field of virtue ethics, and Aristotle's proposal of a 'Golden Mean' is an excellent hypothesis for an idea of 'the good'.

[The Politics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19083.Politics?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=OFLzIdua3O&rank=1) by Aristotle.<br>
This work is a natural progression from Aristotle's _Nicomachean Ethics_ as he moves from a consideration of the individual to a consideration of society. It frustrates me greatly that many more people have read Plato's _Republic_ than Aristotle's _Politics_. I am greatly suspicious of people who read _The Republic_ and state that this is the way to run society, as I see it as advocating a form of fascism. _The Politics_, meanwhile, is a sober attempt to compare and contrast different political systems, and outline their advantages and disadvantages. Aristotle concludes that the ideal form of government is that of the rule by a 'Philosopher King', much like Plato concludes, but Aristotle warns that such a system is extremely susceptible to degeneration into Tyranny. Aristotle states that the next best system of government is by an Aristocracy, but that this can degenerate fairly easily into Oligarchy. Finally, he concludes that the third best form of government is Democracy, and warns that this can descend into Mob Rule. Aristotle states that, as Mob Rule is less likely to arise, and its consequences less serious, than those of either Oligarchy or Tyranny, that Democracy is therefore the best practical form of government. I tend to agree with him on this point.

[Rome’s Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538752-rome-s-last-citizen?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_14) by Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni.<br>
I believe that today Cato the Younger is one of the least appreciated figures in history. This was not always the case - during the American revolutionary era, his name was often invoked. Without being hysterical about it, I think it's not a surprise that in this day and age where his legacy is forgotten, we are sacrificing more and more of our freedoms to increasingly authoritarian regimes. Cato was an implacable enermy of Julius Caesar, recognising that he was a grave threat to the Republic. Cato was a man of great principle, marching across the North African desert barefoot with his troops in a last-ditch attempt to confront Caesar. Upon his defeat, Cato took his own life rather than live under tyranny. His nephew and son-in-law, Brutus, ultimately avenged Cato, being one of the leading members of the conspiracy to murder Caesar, but unfortunately the Republic could not be saved. This book is a very timely biography of a great man.

[Reasonable Faith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455523.Reasonable_Faith?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16) by William Lane Craig.<br>
William Lane Craig is my favourite Christian apologist. His work on the Kalam Cosmological Argument played an instrumental part in me becoming a Christian, and he is the most famous modern expositor of what I feel to be the most fruitful conception of soteriological justice, namely Molinism. In this work, Dr Craig lays out the most effective philosophical, scientific and historical arguments for Christian belief.

[Annihilation of Caste](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551905-annihilation-of-caste?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_26) by B.R. Ambedkar, Introduction by Arundhati Roy.<br>
I believe this to be one of the most important political works ever written. B.R. Ambedkar was the Dalit (i.e. Untouchable) leader during the transition to Indian independence. His life was remarakble, rising from exceptionally humble circumstances (as an Untouchable, he had to sit outside his classroom in the blazing sun, lest he should 'contaminate' the other students) to achieve doctorates from both Columbia University and the London School of Economics. He then headed the committee which drafted the Constitution of India. Ambedkar was implacably opposed to the Congress party, who he saw as being dominated by Brahmins, and his efforts to ensure that Dalits would be treated with dignity in an independent India proved to be of monumental importance (in particular, the system of positive discrimination which he managed to incorporate into the constitution). The lengthy and insightful introduction by Arundhati Roy supplements this work well by discussing the plight of the Dalits in the modern era.

[What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to The Untouchables](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27876195-what-congress-and-gandhi-have-done-to-untouchables?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_18) by B.R. Ambedkar.<br>
This is a more detailed analysis than _Annihilation of Caste_, which served more as a manifesto. This work is a tour de force, which exposes the bigotry many top members of the Congress party had towards the Dalits, and the efforts Gandhi went to in order to prevent them from getting separate electorates (and, by implication, effective representation). Dr Ambedkar rails against Gandhi in this work, in particular with regards to the roles the two men played in the infamous Poona Pact. In order to prevent Dalits from being granted separate electorates, Gandhi threatened to fast unto death. Gandhi realised that his death would result in anti-Dalit riots, with the potential to kill thousands, yet persisted anyway. Ambedkar, despite having earlier been granted separate electorates by the British commission, was therefore forced to concede this political demand. That Gandhi would go to such lengths to disenfranchise the poorest, most oppressed members of Indian society, using emotional blackmail to do so, is remarkable. Unfortunately, so many people are ignorant about Gandhi in the West (and I admit I was once one of them). He was not a great man, and in many ways was a conservative reactionary. Ambedkar, in my opinion, was one of the true heroes of modern India, and his name, rather than Gandhi's, deserves to be known to a wider audience.

_DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.08.010_<br>
Key article on DMS for antibody diagnostics, and potential SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein escape mutations. Profiles for antibodies from many different companies considered.

[Mutational Basin-Hopping: Combined Structure and Sequence Optimization for Biomolecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02839) by Roder and Wales.<br>
_Journal: J. Phys. Chem. Lett. Year: 2018, Volume: 9, Pages: 6169-6173_<br>
_DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02839_<br>
Article which introduces mutational basin-hopping, which formed a large part of Konstantin's PhD research. This is a biminimization approach, which allows for energies to be optimized in conjunction with criteria for mutation acceptance/rejection. I am interested to apply this to protein-antibody binding problems. This could be ambitious, but Konstantin did demonstrate that MBH can be used to accurately predict stabilizing mutations for certain protein-hormone interactions.

[Computationally restoring the potency of a clinical antibody against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants [bioRxiv]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.21.513237v1.full.pdf) by Desautels et al.<br>
_bioRXIV Preprint, Version Posted: Oct 24 2022_<br>
This paper used simulation and machine learning to predict possible antibody mutations to restore efficacy in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein escape mutations. The top predictions were then tested in the lab. The research was impressive, computations did accurately predict effective mutations, but the computational power required was immense.

[Using deep sequencing to characterize the biophysical mechanism of a transcriptional regulatory sequence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1004290107) by Kinney et al.<br>
_Journal: PNAS, Year: 2010, Volume: 107, Pages: 9158-9163_<br>
_DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1004290107_<br>
This paper introduces Sort-Seq, the first paper to use DMS to partition a library of partially mutated regulatory sequences according to their in vivo transcriptional activities, and then sequencing them on mass. It is very technical, and gives a thorough background to the technique.

[Measuring the sequence-affinity landscape of antibodies with massively parallel titration curves](https://elifesciences.org/articles/23156) by Adams et al.<br>
_Journal: eLife, Year: 2016, Volume: 5, Pages: 1-27_<br>
_DOI: 10.7554/eLife.23156_<br>
This paper introduces Tite-Seq, an extension of Sort-Seq which runs over a number of concentrations in order to determine antibodye KD values from their respective binding curves. Very important paper for us going forward.

[The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein forms mutually exclusive condensates with RNA and the membrane-associated M protein](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20768-y) by Lu et al.<br>
_Journal: Nature Comm., Year: 2021, Volume: 12, Pages: 1-15_<br>
_DOI: 10.1038/s41467-020-20768-y_<br>
A paper which considers the role of the nucleocapsid protein in SARS-CoV-2 during the virus' life cycles. It is thought that it can bind to RNA and the membrane, M, protein during different points of this cycle. We are interested to perhaps run DMS on this somewhat novel N-M interaction.

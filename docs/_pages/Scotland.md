_Much may be made of a Scotchman, if he be caught young._ Samuel Johnson

They say that being parted from your country makes you more fond of it. That's certainly the case for me. My family and many of my friends still live there, and I love to visit whenever I get the opportunity. I find that Americans often have a great love for Scotland, often due to long-lost family connections. It's always very nice to hear, and I'll admit to playing into it a bit!

I am from the North-East of Scotland, which is well-known for its whisky production. In fact, I do wonder if my love for chemistry was imbibed from the many local distilleries (indeed, I did work at Glen Grant distillery for a while, as well as the independent bottlers, Gordon & MacPhail). I then studied in Edinburgh for five years, where I loved exploring the Grassmarket, Cowgate, New Town and many other historical areas. Recently, I had the opportunity to go back there for my brother's graduation (pictured).

I am a proud member of Clan Keith, whose chief was historically known as the Earl Marischal, and whose role it was to protect the King's person in parliament. We are a rather contentious clan, with peace treaties with the Gunn and Irvine clans only being signed in 1978 and 2002 respectively! For our support of the Jacobite rebellion, we lost much of our earlier prestige. The clan motto is _Veritas Vincit_, Latin for Truth Conquers. Pictured are the clan crest, and me at my Cambridge graduation in the Keith tartan.

As well as having a Scottish identity, I have a British one too. I am proud, in particular, of my Great-Grandad, Donald McLaren, who was a Spitfire pilot who paid the ultimate sacrifice during World War II.

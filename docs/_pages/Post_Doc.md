I have just started my postdoctoral studies and so have not yet had an opportunity to develop a fully-fledged project.

Broadly, my project aim is to characterize protein-antibody interactions, with a specific focus on protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I aim to integrate standard biophysical methods with deep mutational scanning (for high throughput analysis) and cryo-electron microscopy (for high resolution structural determination).

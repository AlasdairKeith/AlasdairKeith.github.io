<font size="6">Religion</font>

I take an amateur, non-dogmatic interest in religion. I grew up as an atheist but am now convinced that there are many good arguments for the existence of God, including the [Kalam Cosmological Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument), [Ontological Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument) and [Moral Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_morality). I believe in [Molinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism), which I believe is one of the greatest, yet most-underappreciated, theological concepts, as it reconciles God's sovereignty with human free will. I firmly believe that if more people could grasp this argument, then more people would come to believe in God, whether that be under the auspices of Christianity, Islam, Judaism or basic Deism.

<font size="6">Taekwon-Do</font>

In the UK, I enjoyed Taekwon-Do, the Korean martial art, where I primarily trained under Grandmaster John Williamson IX. I am a 1st Dan Black Belt, and was graded by First Grandmaster Rhee Ki Ha. I was a member of the United Kingdom Taekwon-Do Association (UKTA), which is affiliated to the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). Unfortunately, I have not been able to track down any ITF schools in the Atlanta area. Should anybody know of any, please do get in touch, as I'd like to resume training in the USA if possible.

<font size="6"> Haemoproteins</font> 

My main PhD project was on a family of haemoproteins, typically found in pathogenic bacteria such as *Shigella dysenteriae* (the main cause of dysentery), *Yersinia pestis* (historically responsible for the Black Death) and, my main focus, *Yersinia enterocolitica*. Haemoproteins regulate haem exposure, an important consideration given that haem is cytotoxic. Despite this potential harm to cells, haem is essential for virtually all living organisms, as it is a required cofactor in a variety of biochemical processes, including oxygen transport, electron transfer and signal transduction. Many species of bacteria can only produce haem to a limited extent, if at all. Therefore, they are required to steal it from their host organism.

Studies by previous members of the group had centred on HemS, the final haemoprotein of an overall haem-uptake system found in *Y. ent*. It was discovered that HemS can catalyze the breakdown of haem *via* a novel reaction, and I demonstrated that this reaction is not just limited to HemS, but is common to a family of homologues. I also confirmed previous speculation that the reaction is anaerobic, and that it proceeds by hydride from NADH, which is very unusual as most pathogenic haem breakdown processes are oxygen-dependent. Since most bacteria studied specifically target oxygen-depleted regions of the gastrointestinal tract of their host organisms, it was therefore concluded that this alternative haem-breakdown system is important for cell survival, and further study could therefore be of medical importance.

This project involved the use of a variety of molecular biology-based techniques, including DNA manipulation, mutagenesis, PCR, protein expression and protein purification (incl. electrophoresis and HPLC). When it came to studying the novel reaction, a whole suite of techniques were required. Standard biophysical techniques (such as UV-Visible spectroscropy, mass spectrometry, NMR and X-ray crystallography) were supplemented with a detailed bioinformatic study. NADH only binds transiently to HemS, precluding its study *via* standard biophysical means, plus the novelty of reaction meant bioinformatics could only determine so much. Therefore, detailed calculation using an [energy landscapes approach](https://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/~wales/wales.html) was utilised to determine the features of NADH binding and its interactions with haem.

<font size="6"> Viruses</font>

For my first-year project, I investigated virus capsid maturation processes. A capsid is the protein coat which encloses the genetic material of the virus, and maturation is the change of shape a virus is typically required to undergo in order to become infectious.. The project mainly involved coarse-grained simulations of the HK97 virus, in order to better understand the fundamental geometrical and symmetrical principles these capsids obey.

<font size="6"> Glucagon-Like Peptides</font>

I also engaged in a side-project on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) with a fellow PhD student. GLP-1 is a peptide hormone which stimulates a decrease in blood glucose levels. It is therefore a potential therapeutic for type 2 diabetes. This project was theoretical in nature, and used computational simulations to track GLP-1 conformational changes with respect to changing pH levels.

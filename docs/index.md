I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [Ortlund Lab](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biochemistry/research-labs/ortlund/index.html) in the Department of Biochemistry at Emory University, Atlanta, GA. Previously, I completed my PhD studies at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Professor David Wales](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/dw34) and [Dr Paul Barker](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/pdb30). This research involved biophysical, bioinformatic and computational analyses of a novel haem breakdown reaction discovered in certain pathogenic bacteria. My thesis can be found in the [Cambridge Apollo Repository](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/332914). Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained an MChem degree in Chemistry with Nanotechnology, from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/engineering-physical-sciences/teaching/chemistry.htm), Edinburgh. I also completed two summer internships, at the [Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research](https://www.mpip-mainz.mpg.de/en/home) in Mainz, Germany in 2015, and at the [University of Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/chm/groups/krauss/), NY in 2016.

My current research involves deep mutational screening and other biophysical, structural, and biochemical approaches to fully characterize protein interactions with antibodies as well as physiological interaction partners, with a specific focus on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. My research interests span the fields of biochemistry, molecular biology, biophysical chemistry, nanotechnology, bioinformatics, microscopy and computational coding.  I am a member of the [American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](https://www.asbmb.org/).

Though exiled to America (a country which I've fallen in love with), I remain a passionate Scot. I follow Scottish football and British politics avidly. When away from the lab, I like to swim, read books (on basically anything), train at Taekwon-do and quite literally travel the road less traveled. I also wrote a novel when I was 15, which can be found [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Man-Who-Fooled-Scotland/dp/1500522368).

I have a deep interest in the interplay between science and religion, and some of my theological musings can be found in the etc tab. I can often be found at [Decatur First United Methodist Church](https://decaturfirst.org/) on a Sunday with my partner, Allison.
